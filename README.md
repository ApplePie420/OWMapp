# OWMapp

OWMapp is a simple, minimalistic weather application written in Python3, using OpenWeatherMap API and Kivy GUI libraries. It is meant to be run on Raspberry Pi or any embedded SBC with python and 320x240 TFT LCD screen at least.

# Code

Code is **NOT** commented for "tutorial" purposes, it is meant to be pulled and runned. If you want to dig throught code, i strongly recommend you to learn Kivy and OpenWeatherMap API, otherwise you may only look at my beautiful elif compilation :)

# Libraries

Libs i used are:
-Kivy (GUI)
-OpenWeatherMap (weather data and API)
-Datetime (standart library for time)
